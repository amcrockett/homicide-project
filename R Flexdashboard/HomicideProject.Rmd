```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(flexdashboard)
library(tidyverse)


read_combine_multiple_csv <- function(path, pattern = "*.csv") {
    files = list.files(path, pattern, full.names = TRUE)
    lapply(files, read_csv) %>% 
      lapply(function(x) filter(x, DATE > '1964-12-30')) %>%
      reduce(inner_join, by = "DATE")
}
```

# Crime
```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE}

homicide = read_csv('../Data/UCR65_18.csv') %>%
  mutate(Unsolved = MRD - CLR)

state_population = read_combine_multiple_csv("../Data/StatePopulations")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
